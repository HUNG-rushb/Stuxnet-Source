#### right now it is text and stuff all over the place; will clean it up (therefore Branch #2)
[2nd branch](https://github.com/loneicewolf/Stuxnet-Source/tree/2022_clean)



## MAJOR UPDATE: 
will soon update this one with a live-demo of a simulated PLC workstation, which will be infiltrated(as a first step) (offline; (airgapped)) with fanny.bmp and then StuxNet; (and; why not infect it with gauss/duqu/regin and flame as well??) and try it on different types (64 bit; 32 bit; win xp; vista; ...)
even though it (was designed) to just work on 1 specific thing; which had one specific PLC-config-block(you name it); it would do some;things like mark the system "don't infect this one; this is not the correct target" or.. "don't re infect this system; I am on it"-StuxnetWorm (how it *probably* reasoning)

anyway; Will do this after my OSCP exam is passed;
and when I verified I really do have the knowledge; not just 'passing'. But for this repo I will update it just after I have passed my OSCP exam.

please; contact me for further details. mail and discord can be found on my Github Profile.


**`will clean this up later.`**

Old "update" message.
--- - Recording (From scratch(0%), to 100%) of when StuXnet infects a PLC (although a virtual one, since I have not *real* access to a nuclear reactor.. For.. well, quite - **obvious reasons.**
 - Recording (again, From 0 to 100%)  of how one can "re-weaponize" Fanny.bmp (or,DementiaWheel as it's codename suggests) the USB-Backdoor to carry commands from & to Metasploit. (This is tested and, let's just say - it works, but needs improvement. (Massive improvements that is)) <- Still working on it.
 - A mini-library written in C (in combination with Lua) to make (the 2 points above ) a **bit** more user-friendly 
 -    (JUST so you don't need to be a debugger-professional to understand how to get a reverse shell trough fanny's USB Backdoor for example.)

## STUXNET
*is a Worm that attacked Nuclear Power plants, trough unusual vulnerabilities. So-called 0Day vulnerabilities.*

## Basic Overview:

Includes:
- Source files,
- Binaries,
- PLC Sample program

### fanny.bmp - (malware) what is it?
- Fanny (known as fanny.bmp or, the classical a,b,c,d,e,...,__j__.lnk worm,(Is (likely) **not ** visible in Windows XP and such, (but I have seen some versions of it where it has a,b and c - all the way up to j)- on other versions of Windows.  

- Propagates trough Removable USB devices, which has a extremely sophisticated Rootkit, which not only hides itself, but adds itself at startup in the reg in windows machines, but it has also some other, quite shocking capabilities, such as a submodule to re-program hardware, (more specifically, HDD's Firmware) for **Extreme persistence.**)
   It exploited same vulns as Stuxnet did, and has striking similarities with it, and was used **before even Stuxnet was used**)
